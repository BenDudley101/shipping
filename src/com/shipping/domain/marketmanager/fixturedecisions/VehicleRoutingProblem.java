/*
The VRP is about how specific vehicles (like delivery trucks) should move to deliver goods to customers.

The problem focuses on which vehicle should go on which route and how to plan the delivery to minimize things
like travel time, cost, or distance.

Itâ€™s about the paths each truck takes and the best way to organize and route the trucks, considering the
number of vehicles you have and their capacities.
