/*
The Knapsack Problem is about selecting items to fit in a knapsack (or container) with a limited weight capacity,
in order to maximize the total value of the items selected.

Objective: Choose a set of items to pack into the knapsack such that the total weight does not exceed the capacity
of the knapsack, and the total value of the items is maximized.

Example: Imagine you have a backpack (the knapsack) that can carry a total weight of 10 kg. You have a list of items,
each with a weight and a value (e.g., a gold bar weighing 5 kg with a value of 50 dollars, a book weighing 3 kg with
a value of 30 dollars). The goal is to figure out which combination of items to pack into your backpack to maximize
the total value without exceeding the 10 kg weight limit.
