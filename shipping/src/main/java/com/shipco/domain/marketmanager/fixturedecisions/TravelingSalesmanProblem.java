Goal is to figure out the shortest possible route that a salesperson (or traveler) can take to visit a set of cities
(or locations) exactly once and then return to the starting point.

Itâ€™s only about one traveler or one vehicle (no multiple commodities, no multiple vehicles). The goal is to find the
most efficient route that visits each city once and minimizes the total distance traveled (or total cost).
